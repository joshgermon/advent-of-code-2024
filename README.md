# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 - Rust Solutions 🦀


## Overview

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! This project contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges, implemented in Rust. Each day brings a new programming puzzle, and I'm excited to solve them using Rust's powerful and efficient features.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version)
- Cargo (Rust's package manager and build tool)

## 🧊 Running Solutions

To run a specific day's solution:

```bash
# Navigate to the day's directory
cd day-1

# Run the solution
cargo run

```

To run tests:

```bash

# In each day's directory
cargo test
```

## 📝 Notes

- Solutions are my own attempts and may not be the most optimized
- Sometimes I like to go in and refactor solutions to improve performance or reduce loc needed
